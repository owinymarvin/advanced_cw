        },
        {
            'question': "How can I transfer land ownership?",
            'answer': "To transfer land ownership in Uganda, the current owner must have a registered title. The transfer involves signing a sale agreement, obtaining consent from the land office, and registering the transaction with the land registry."
        },
        {
            'question': "What is a land title deed?",
            'answer': "A land title deed is an official document issued by the Land Registry that confirms a personâ€™s legal ownership of a piece of land. The title contains details such as the land's location, size, and ownership history."
        },
        {
            'question': "What is the difference between freehold and leasehold land?",
            'answer': "Freehold land is land owned outright and can be transferred, sold, or inherited. Leasehold land, on the other hand, is leased from the government or a private entity for a specific period, after which the lease can be renewed or reverted back."
        },
        {
            'question': "Can I use land without a title?",
            'answer': "Yes, land can be used without a title under customary land tenure systems, but the use is often less secure compared to titled land. It is advisable to register land to ensure proper ownership rights."
        },
        {
            'question': "What are land taxes in Uganda?",
            'answer': "Land owners in Uganda are required to pay annual land rent and taxes, including property taxes. These taxes are calculated based on the value of the land and the type of land tenure system it falls under."
